                        <p>With TEZISH, you earn your money anytime, anywhere. That is, with the Tezish program, you work in short-term jobs. The issue is that a restaurant is looking for a waiter on August 15 from 17:00 to 23:00, and if the time, place, and payment are suitable for you, you apply. If you are selected, you go and work for 6 hours and get your payment.</p>

                        <p>No, jobs at TEZISH are short-term. That is, it can be hourly, daily or weekly. However, some of the companies where you worked for a short time may offer you a long-term (ie, permanent) job. For this, please read the announcements carefully.</p>

                        <p>After you register in the TEZISH application, we interview you for 5 minutes to learn more about you and inform you about TEZISH. Depending on your wishes, we can conduct the interview in one of our Narimanov or Bayil offices or by video on the phone.</p>

                        <p>Your company will give you your earnings immediately after you complete and successfully complete the internship. In addition, your earnings will be paid at the end of full work, not daily. The thing is, if the rush is for 5 hours, your profit will be given at the end of the 5th hour. However, if the grace period is 2 days, your earnings will be fully paid at the end of the 2nd day instead of every day. </p>

                        <p>The decision whether the tip (service charge) is entirely up to you, split with the team, or not given to you at all depends on that company and will be noted in the notice of termination.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, if the working hours end at midnight, the transportation costs will be covered by the company depending on the decision of the company posting the overtime announcement and will be mentioned in the overtime announcement.</p>
